CCTVRECORD.PY

1. PURPOSE:
RTSP stream capture and recording system for DVR/CCTV cameras with automatic reconnection and timestamped video output.

2. STRUCTURE:
Imports: cv2, time, datetime
Classes: None
Functions: None (procedural script)
Constants: DVR_IP, USERNAME, PASSWORD, CHANNEL, STREAM_TYPE configuration

3. USAGE:
Run script to connect to DVR RTSP stream, display live feed, and record timestamped video files - press 'q' to stop.

4. NOTES:
Strengths: Automatic reconnection on stream failure, timestamped output files, buffer optimization for reduced delay
Limitations: Hard-coded DVR credentials, basic stream handling, no object detection or alert system

"""
RTSP2.PY

1. PURPOSE:
Basic RTSP stream capture and display system for viewing live camera feeds from DVR/CCTV devices.

2. STRUCTURE:
Imports: cv2
Classes: None
Functions: None (minimal procedural script)
Constants: rtsp_url template string (requires parameter substitution)

3. USAGE:
Run script to display live RTSP stream - requires filling in username, password, DVR IP, and channel parameters in URL.

4. NOTES:
Strengths: Extremely simple implementation, minimal dependencies
Limitations: Incomplete URL (requires parameter substitution), no error recovery, basic functionality only

"""
RTSP3.PY

1. PURPOSE:
RTSP stream capture and display system with automatic reconnection and performance optimization for DVR/CCTV feeds.

2. STRUCTURE:
Imports: cv2, time
Classes: None
Functions: None (procedural script with reconnection logic)
Constants: rtsp_url template string (requires parameter substitution)

3. USAGE:
Run script to display live RTSP stream with automatic reconnection on failures - requires filling URL parameters.

4. NOTES:
Strengths: Automatic reconnection logic, buffer optimization for reduced latency, performance tuning
Limitations: Incomplete URL (requires parameter substitution), no recording functionality, basic error handling
